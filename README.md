# Speech-to-Text to SRT Converter (GNU 3.0 License)

Welcome to the Speech-to-Text to SRT Converter script repository! This Python script simplifies the process of converting speech-to-text output files into SubRip Subtitle (SRT) format. It's a valuable tool for anyone working with transcriptions, subtitles, or multimedia content that requires accurate timing and synchronization.

## Features

This is to convert a speech-to-text output file to be in the form of SRT.
See what is the input and what is the output:

### input (Txt)
{QTtext} {font:Tahoma}
{plain} {size:20}
{timeScale:30}
{width:160} {height:32}
{timestamps:absolute} {language:0}
[00:00:11.15]
Toda a gente me conhece 
[00:00:14.01]

[00:00:14.01]
e têm muito respeito por mim, toda a gente.
[00:00:16.17]

[00:00:16.17]
Eu também tenho.
[00:00:17.20]

[00:00:21.01]
O meu pai era arrais da campanha,
[00:00:23.18]

[00:00:23.18]
da sardinha,
[00:00:25.04]

[00:00:25.04]
do carapau, lulas.
[00:00:26.19]

### Output (SRT):

1
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:14,010
Toda a gente me conhece

2
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,170
e têm muito respeito por mim, toda a gente.

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:17,200
Eu também tenho.

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:23,180
O meu pai era arrais da campanha,

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,040
da sardinha,

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,190
do carapau, lulas.

- **Accurate Conversion:** The script extracts timestamps and text from speech-to-text output files and converts them into SRT format while preserving precise timing.

- **Dynamic Timecode Handling:** Handles both start and end timecodes intelligently. If an end timecode is not provided, it automatically calculates a reasonable duration for each subtitle.

- **Flexible Input:** Works with speech-to-text output files in a specific format, making it adaptable for various speech recognition services.

- **Batch Processing:** Effortlessly convert multiple speech-to-text files in a folder, streamlining your workflow.

- **Customization:** The script is open-source, allowing you to modify it to suit your specific needs and preferences.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Place your speech-to-text output files (in the specified format) in a folder.

3. Specify the input folder path and output folder path in the script.

4. Run the script, and it will automatically convert the files to SRT format and save them in the output directory.

## Example

```python
# Example configuration
input_folder_path = "/path/to/your/input/folder"  # Replace with the folder containing speech-to-text output files
output_folder_path = "/path/to/your/output/folder"  # Replace with the folder where you want to save SRT files

# Run the conversion process
process_folder(input_folder_path, output_folder_path)
```
